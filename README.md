# NYC-Taxi-data-analysis
The NYC Taxi industry is facing both driver and customer churn.
Yellow taxis face fierce completion from Uber.
Uber fleet outnumbers Yellow Taxis by 1.5x.
Uber has about 25000 new users in NY signing up every week.
Taxi owners are in financial crisis owing to large loans taken for buying medallions.
They have started to look towards new initiatives to stay competitive.
Two apps have been launched – Arro (10,000 downloads) & Way2Ride (4000).

Advantages of NYC Taxi over Uber:
-Metered rates
-Professional drivers
-Regulated environment

## First Goal

First Goal will be to look into the data from deep quarters and find if there are any particular trend in the data.

## Second Goal

Get different variables from different data sources, like divide the data into boroughs and if see there are any trends in terms of boroughs.

## First real analysis of the project - To answer a question.

NYC Taxi – does Uber serve unmet demand or compete with yellow taxis in NYC?
Uber is offered in NYC, along with the NYC Taxi (Yellow cabs). We want to explore to what extent is Uber competing for NYC taxi customers, and to what extent is Uber serving unmet demand. For example, if out of a total of 1 million rides, the NYC taxis are serving 800,000 rides, and Uber is serving 200,000 rides, there could be three possibilities:
(a)    If Uber was not there, NYC taxis still serve 800,000 rides. In this case, Uber is said to serve unmet demand.

(b)    If Uber was not there, NYC taxis might have served 1 million rides. In this case, Uber is fully competing with NYC Taxis for customers.

(c)     If Uber was not there, NYC taxis might have served 950,000 rides. In this case, Uber is partially serving unmet demand (50,000 rides) and partially competing with NYC Taxis (150,000 rides).

Most probably, scenario (c) may be happening, with different numbers than the above. Our goal is to estimate the extent to which Uber is competing with NYC Taxis.

## Analysis Approac
Selected 5 locations in the New York Region:
Considered a good mix of High-foot fall locations, Tourist spots and Transport hubs.

Rockefeller Center 
Times Square  
World Trade Center  
Grand Central 
Port Authority
Found out the number of Uber VS NYC Taxi Pickups for these location.

## Results for 1st question
If Uber didn't existed NYC taxi would have got more rides (NYC taxi was more than capable of meeting the demand in all the 5 locations) , which means that UBER is competing with NYC taxi and taking away NYC taxi rides.
